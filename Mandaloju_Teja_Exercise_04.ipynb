        "   - Optimal Topics: 16, with a peak coherence score of 0.4825 for 16 topics.\n",
        "   - Coherence: The scores generally increase as the number of topics grows, but coherence plateaus around 16 topics.\n",
        "   - Topic Interpretability: Topics in LDA are interpretable and cover distinct themes such as \"detective stories,\" \"recipe collections,\" and \"military topics,\"\n",
        "     showing its ability to create well-differentiated topics.\n",
        "   - Strengths: Suitable for medium-sized datasets where coherence and interpretability are important.\n",
        "   - Limitations: LDA topics may lack granularity and do not always capture nuanced or contextual themes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.LSA Results:\n",
        "   - Optimal Topics: 2, based on dimensional reduction.\n",
        "   - Interpretability: LSA topics are broad, capturing general themes such as \"life\" and \"entrepreneurship.\" These topics tend to be more abstract and less granular.\n",
        "   - Strengths: Effective for datasets where themes are few or the primary focus is broad categorization.\n",
        "   - Limitations: LSA may not perform well with detailed datasets since it lacks the capability to model nuanced topics. The topics produced tend to be more general\n",
        "     and potentially lack diversity.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.BERTopic Results\n",
        "   - Optimal Topics: 40, as identified by the loop run.\n",
        "   - Interpretability: Topics are highly specific, with themes like \"recipes and cooking,\" \"court and royalty,\" \"American political figures,\" and\n",
        "     \"startup fundraising.\" BERTopic's approach provides detailed, context-rich themes that capture nuanced aspects effectively.\n",
        "   - Strengths: Highly interpretable with fine-grained topics, ideal for datasets that cover a variety of niche themes. It also leverages embeddings to capture\n",
        "     semantic similarity, which helps in understanding subtle differences between topics.\n",
        "   - Limitations: Potential over-clustering; the algorithm may produce too many small topics, which could require additional filtering or merging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion:\n",
        "   - Overall Best Model: BERTopic emerges as the best model in this scenario because of its fine-grained, interpretable topics and ability to capture nuanced\n",
        "     themes using contextual embeddings. This makes it suitable for complex datasets with diverse themes.\n",
        "   - Reasoning: BERTopic's use of embeddings provides a more context-sensitive clustering than LDA or LSA, which rely on simpler statistical methods and can\n",
        "     overlook subtleties. LDA performs well but lacks the depth of BERTopic, while LSA is less suitable due to its tendency to yield broad topics.\n",
